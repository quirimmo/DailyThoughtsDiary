# Dialy Thoughts Diary

A react native application with expo, for taking notes about daily thoughts, location where you are at that stage, 
symptoms and information about it.

You can then display all these items and print a PDF of these reports.

The app was committed by a psychologist who wanted to provide a mobile application to patients in order to keep track of these thoughts.
